# map2prot
Tool for mapping peptides onto a protein sequence

## About
Welcome to the map2prot repository. Here you will find ...

## The map2prot tool
The scripts contained in this repository are tools for exploring the results of [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org/) 'dependent peptide' searches. Each script processes a set of search results (one or more allPeptides.txt files) and generates a graphic. The scripts originally appeared alongside our article as supplementary files (S1-S5 Scripts). 

* Point 1
* Point 2

All scripts were written in [R for Windows](https://www.R-project.org/) and require R package [seqinr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqinr/index.html). They were last tested on files generated by MaxQuant version 1.6.0.1, using R version 3.6.0 and seqinr version 3.4-5.
